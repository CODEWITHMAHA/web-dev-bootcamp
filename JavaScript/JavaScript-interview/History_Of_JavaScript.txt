Q1:Can you tell me a brief history of JavaScript — who created it, when, and why?

Ans: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications.
It was originally developed in just 10 days to make web pages more interactive — allowing browsers to run code directly on the client side, rather than relying only on server-side languages like Perl or Java.

Initially, it was called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript for marketing reasons — to leverage the popularity of Java at that time.

Later, it was standardized by ECMA International under the name ECMAScript, with ECMAScript 3 (1999) being the first major version that shaped the language we know today.

Today, JavaScript powers not just browsers, but also servers (Node.js), mobile apps, and even IoT devices — making it one of the most widely used languages in the world.

Q2: Is JavaScript interpreted or compiled?

Ans: Traditionally, JavaScript is an interpreted language, because the code was executed line by line by the browser’s JavaScript engine without a separate compilation step.

However, modern JavaScript engines (like Google’s V8, SpiderMonkey, or Chakra) actually use a technique called Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

Here’s how it works:

The code is first parsed and converted into bytecode or machine code at runtime.
Then, frequently executed parts are optimized and compiled for better performance.

So today, we say JavaScript is both interpreted and compiled — interpreted at a high level, but compiled internally using JIT for speed.

Q3: What is ECMAScript and how is it related to JavaScript?

✅ Answer:
ECMAScript is the official standard that defines how JavaScript should work.
JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard, defined by ECMA International under ECMA-262.
Every major JavaScript engine (like V8 or SpiderMonkey) follows ECMAScript specifications to ensure consistent behavior across browsers.

Q4: What is ES6 and why is it important?

✅ Answer:
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) was a major update to JavaScript that introduced features like let/const, arrow functions, classes, template literals, modules, and promises.
It made JavaScript more powerful, modern, and easier to write — especially for large applications.

Q4: Why was JavaScript created when Java already existed?

✅ Answer:
JavaScript was designed to make web pages interactive, while Java was mainly for building applications.
JavaScript runs directly in the browser and is easy for non-programmers to learn, while Java needs compilation and runs on the server or JVM.
So, JavaScript was created to add client-side scripting to HTML.

Q6: What was the first version of JavaScript called?

✅ Answer:
The first version was named Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript in 1995 for marketing reasons.

Q7: How did JavaScript evolve into modern frameworks like React or Node.js?

✅ Answer:
As browsers and web apps grew more complex, JavaScript evolved with new features (ES6+) and runtime environments like Node.js (2009) that allowed it to run outside browsers.
This led to the rise of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, enabling JavaScript to power full-stack development.
