💬 Question 1: What is a variable in JavaScript?

✅ Answer:
A variable in JavaScript is a named container used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated later.
Variables allow developers to store values — such as numbers, strings, objects, or functions — and reuse them throughout the program.

let name = "Maha";
let age = 21;

💡 Bonus line:

“Variables act as identifiers for data in memory, enabling dynamic behavior in JavaScript since it’s a loosely typed language.”

💬 Question 2: What are the different ways to declare variables in JavaScript?

✅ Answer:
JavaScript provides three keywords for declaring variables:

var → Function-scoped, hoisted, can be re-declared & updated.

let → Block-scoped, not hoisted in the same way, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.

const → Block-scoped, must be initialized at declaration, cannot be updated or re-declared.

💬 Question 3: What is the difference between var, let, and const?

✅ Answer (interview-favorite table):

Feature	var	let	const
Scope	Function-scoped	Block-scoped	Block-scoped
Hoisting	Yes (initialized as undefined)	Yes (but in TDZ)	Yes (but in TDZ)
Redeclaration	Allowed	❌ Not allowed	❌ Not allowed
Reassignment	Allowed	Allowed	❌ Not allowed
Initialization	Optional	Optional	Mandatory
Use Case	Legacy code	For variables that can change	For fixed values

💬 Question 4: What is Hoisting? How does it work with var, let, and const?

✅ Answer:
Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.

However, behavior differs between var, let, and const:

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 20;

console.log(c); // ReferenceError
const c = 30;

💡 Explanation:

var is hoisted and initialized as undefined.

let and const are also hoisted but remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their declaration is reached — hence, accessing them earlier throws an error.

💬 Bonus line:

“Understanding hoisting helps prevent runtime bugs caused by accessing variables before initialization.”

💬 Question 5: What is the difference between Global Scope, Function Scope, and Block Scope?

✅ Answer:

Global Scope:
Accessible everywhere in the program.
Example: variables declared outside any function/block.

Function Scope:
Variables declared with var inside a function are accessible only within that function.

Block Scope:
Variables declared with let or const inside {} are accessible only inside that block.

{
  let x = 10;
  var y = 20;
}
console.log(y); // ✅ 20
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError

💡 Bonus line:

“Block scope introduced with let and const in ES6 made JavaScript much safer and more predictable.”

💬 Question 6: What happens if you declare a variable without using var, let, or const?

✅ Answer:
If a variable is declared without any keyword, it automatically becomes a global variable — even if it’s inside a function.
This is considered bad practice, as it can lead to bugs or accidental overwrites.

function test() {
  x = 10; // implicitly global
}
test();
console.log(x); // 10
💡 Bonus line:

“Implicit globals break encapsulation, so modern JavaScript best practice is to always use let or const.”

💬 Question 7: Can const objects or arrays be modified?

✅ Answer:
Yes — a const variable’s reference cannot change, but the content it points to can be modified.
const person = { name: "Maha" };
person.name = "Khan"; // ✅ Allowed
// person = {}; ❌ Not allowed

💡 Bonus line:

“const makes the reference immutable, not the value — that’s why for full immutability, we use deep cloning or Object.freeze().”

💬 Question:

👉 What is the difference between function scope and block scope in JavaScript?

✅ Answer (Professional & Interview-Ready):

In JavaScript, scope determines where a variable is accessible in your code.
There are two main types of local scope: function scope and block scope.

🧩 1. Function Scope

Variables declared with var are function-scoped.

This means they are only accessible inside the function in which they are declared — not outside it.

However, if var is used inside a block (like an if or for statement), it ignores the block and remains accessible throughout the entire function.

🧠 Example:

function test() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10;
  }
  console.log(x); // ✅ 10 — accessible because var is function-scoped
}
test();


💡 Even though x is declared inside an if block, it’s still available throughout the function.

🧩 2. Block Scope

Variables declared with let or const are block-scoped.

A block is anything enclosed in curly braces {} — like if, for, or while.

Block-scoped variables are accessible only within that block and not outside it.

🧠 Example:

function test() {
  if (true) {
    let y = 20;
    const z = 30;
  }
  console.log(y); // ❌ ReferenceError
  console.log(z); // ❌ ReferenceError
}
test();


💡 y and z are not accessible outside the if block — that’s block scope.

⚖️ Key Differences Table
Feature	Function Scope (var)	Block Scope (let / const)
Visibility	Visible throughout the entire function	Visible only inside the block {}
Keyword	var	let, const
Example	if, for, etc. don’t limit scope	Variables vanish outside {}
Hoisting	Hoisted & initialized as undefined	Hoisted but in Temporal Dead Zone
Best Practice	Avoid in modern JS	Always prefer let or const
⚡ Bonus (Impressive Interview Line):

“Before ES6, JavaScript only had function scope via var, which often caused unexpected behavior. The introduction of let and const in ES6 finally gave us true block scoping — making code safer and more predictable.”
