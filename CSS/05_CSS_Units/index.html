  <H1>CSS UNITS</H1>
  <p>CSS units are used to specify lengths, sizes, and other measurements in CSS. They can be broadly categorized into
    absolute and relative units.</p>
  <section>
    <h2>Absolute Units</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>px (pixels):</strong> A pixel is a single dot on the screen. It is a fixed unit and does not change
        based on other factors.</li>
      <li><strong>cm (centimeters):</strong> A centimeter is a physical measurement. It is rarely used in web design due
        to varying screen sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>mm (millimeters):</strong> Similar to centimeters, millimeters are also physical measurements.</li>
      <li><strong>in (inches):</strong> An inch is another physical measurement, equivalent to 2.54 centimeters.</li>
      <li><strong>pt (points):</strong> A point is 1/72 of an inch, commonly used in print media.</li>
      <li><strong>pc (picas):</strong> A pica is equal to 12 points or 1/6 of an inch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Relative Units</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>em:</strong> The em unit is relative to the font-size of the parent element. For example, 2em means
        twice the size of the current font.</li>
      <li><strong>rem (root em):</strong> The rem unit is relative to the font-size of the root element (usually the
        <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element).
      </li>
      <li><strong>% (percentage):</strong> Percentage units are relative to the parent element's size. For example, a
        width
        of 50% means half the width of the parent element.</li>
      <li><strong>vw (viewport width):</strong> 1vw is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport (the browser window).
      </li>
      <li><strong>vh (viewport height):</strong> 1vh is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport.</li>
      <li><strong>vmin:</strong> vmin is equal to 1% of the smaller dimension (width or height) of the viewport.</li>
      <li><strong>vmax:</strong> vmax is equal to 1% of the larger dimension (width or height) of the viewport.</li>
    </ul>
