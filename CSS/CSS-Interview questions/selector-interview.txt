💬 Top CSS Selector Interview Questions (with Answers)
🔹 1. What are CSS selectors?

Answer:
Selectors are patterns used to target HTML elements and apply CSS styles to them.
Example:

p { color: red; }


This targets all <p> elements.

.

🔹 2. What is the difference between class selector and ID selector?

Answer:

Feature	Class Selector (.classname)	ID Selector (#idname)
Symbol	.	#
Usage	Can be used on multiple elements	Used on only one element
Specificity	Lower specificity	Higher specificity
Example	.btn { color: red; }	#header { color: blue; }
🔹 3. Can you use multiple classes on one element?

Answer:
Yes ✅. You can assign multiple classes by separating them with spaces.
Example:

<div class="card shadow dark"></div>

🔹 4. What is the difference between div p and div > p selectors?

Answer:

div p → selects all <p> elements inside a <div> (descendant selector).

div > p → selects only direct child <p> elements of <div> (child selector).

🔹 5. What is the difference between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?

Answer:

Feature	Pseudo-class	Pseudo-element
Symbol	:	::
Purpose	Targets state of an element	Targets part of an element
Example	a:hover { color: red; }	p::first-line { font-weight: bold; }
🔹 6. What does the universal selector (*) do?

Answer:
It selects every element on the page.
Example:

* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }

🔹 7. What are attribute selectors?

Answer:
They select elements based on their attributes or values.
Examples:

input[type="text"] { color: blue; }
a[target="_blank"] { color: green; }

🔹 8. Can you combine multiple selectors?

Answer:
Yes ✅. You can group or combine selectors to apply the same style:

h1, h2, h3 { color: purple; } /* Grouped selectors */

🔹 9. What is the specificity hierarchy in CSS selectors?

Answer:
Specificity determines which CSS rule takes priority.
Order of power (lowest → highest):

Universal selector *

Element selector (p, div)

Class, pseudo-class, attribute selectors (.class, :hover, [type])

ID selector (#id)

Inline styles (style="" in HTML)

!important (overrides all)

🔹 10. What is a combinator in CSS?

Answer:
A combinator defines a relationship between two selectors.
Types:

descendant (A B)

child (A > B)

adjacent sibling (A + B)

general sibling (A ~ B)

Example:

div + p { color: blue; } /* Targets <p> immediately after a <div> */

🔹 11. What is the difference between :nth-child() and :nth-of-type()?

Answer:

:nth-child(n) → selects based on child position (counting all types).

:nth-of-type(n) → selects based on position among the same element type.

Example:

p:nth-child(2) { color: red; }      /* 2nd child (whatever tag) */
p:nth-of-type(2) { color: blue; }   /* 2nd <p> only */

🔹 12. What is a descendant selector?

Answer:
Selects all elements inside a specific element (no matter how deep).
Example:

div p { color: gray; }  /* All <p> inside <div> */

🔹 13. What is the difference between a:link, a:visited, a:hover, and a:active?

Answer:
These are pseudo-classes for link states:

a:link { color: blue; }      /* Unvisited link */
a:visited { color: purple; } /* Visited link */
a:hover { color: red; }      /* When mouse is over */
a:active { color: green; }   /* When clicked */

🔹 14. What is a group selector and why use it?

Answer:
Used to reduce repetition when multiple selectors share the same style.

h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Arial; }

🔹 15. What is a not (:not()) selector?

Answer:
It excludes elements that match a condition.

p:not(.highlight) { color: gray; }


→ Styles all <p> except those with class “highlight”.
