    <h1 id="heading">Cascading</h1>
    <p class="ans">Cascading in CSS means that when multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, the browser decides
      which rule takes priority based on three main factors</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Specificity (How specific the selector is)</li>
      <li>Source order (The rule that appears last)</li>
      <li>Importance (If the rule uses !important)</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="ans">In short — the browser “cascades” through all the possible styles and chooses the most relevant one.
    </p>
    <p>Cascading means that when multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, the browser determines which styles to
      apply based on priority rules — importance (!important), specificity (type, class, or ID), and source order (the
      last rule wins). That’s why CSS is called Cascading Style Sheets</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Specificity</h2>
    <p>Specificity in CSS defines which selector is stronger when multiple rules target the same element. The browser
      assigns weight to each selector — inline styles > IDs > classes > elements. The rule with the highest specificity
      wins unless !important is used.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Inheritance in CSS means that some properties are automatically passed from parent elements to child elements.
      For example, text color and font family are inherited, but box-model properties like margin or border are not. You
      can force inheritance using the inherit keyword</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Difference Between Cascade and Specificity in CSS</h2>
    <p>The cascade in CSS is the overall process that determines which styles are applied when multiple rules target the
      same element. It takes into account the rule’s importance (!important), specificity, and order in the stylesheet.
    </p>

    <p>Specificity is just one part of the cascade — it measures how specific a selector is. For example, an ID selector
      is more specific than a class or element selector.</p>

    <p>So, specificity is a ranking mechanism, while the cascade is the decision-making process that uses specificity
      (along with other factors) to resolve conflicts.</p>
